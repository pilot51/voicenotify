Voice Notify is an Android app that uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to announce status bar notification messages so you don't need to look at the screen to know what a notification says.

WARNING: F-Droid builds apps from source using a different signing key than the builds posted on Google Play and GitHub, meaning they are NOT UPGRADE-COMPATIBLE and you would need to uninstall before installing from a different download source, losing your settings. This is a security feature in Android. The builds on GitHub are the exact same ones published on Google Play and do not have this issue. However, for technical reasons, Android similarly prevents downgrading installed apps to an earlier version.
